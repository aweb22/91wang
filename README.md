The PHP standard tags are primarily used to identify the beginning and end of PHP code, ensuring that the parser can correctly recognize and execute the PHP code. The following is a detailed introduction to the PHP standard tags:

PHP Standard Tags
The standard tags for PHP are <?php and ?>. Any text between these two tags will be interpreted as PHP code to be executed.

Recommended Markup Style
XML Style: This is the most common form in PHP and is also officially recommended. The tags in this style are clear and readable, and it is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. This tag style can be used on all servers, and it is especially important when writing applications for different server environments.

Short Syntax: This syntax style is the simplest to use, but it requires enabling the short_open_tag option in the configuration file php.ini. However, this syntax style is not recommended for everyday development as it is often disabled by default in many environments.

Other Marking Styles
In addition to the default tag style, PHP also supports the following tag styles:

ASP Style: This tag style is the same as ASP or ASP.NET and is disabled by default. To use it, you need to enable the asp_tags option in the configuration settings. However, this tag style is no longer supported in PHP 7.

SCRIPT style: This tagging style is the longest and will be familiar to readers who have used JavaScript or VBScript. It is no longer supported in PHP 7.

Notes
If the file content is pure PHP code, it's best to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This avoids accidentally inserting spaces or line breaks after the PHP closing tag, which could lead to unexpected spaces and line breaks in the output.

It is crucial to adhere to good programming styles and standards when writing PHP code. This not only helps improve the readability of the code but also ensures the compatibility and portability of the code.

By using PHP's standard tags correctly, we can write and manage PHP code more effectively, improving the readability and maintainability of our code. We hope the information above has been helpful to you!
